# AI-Driven Cybersecurity: Enhancing Threat Detection and Response  

## Overview  
This project focuses on leveraging AI and machine learning models for cybersecurity threat detection. The goal is to enhance threat detection and response using various machine learning and deep learning techniques.  

## Models Implemented  
The following models are implemented in this repository:  
- **Autoencoder** (`Autoencoder.ipynb`)  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** (`CNN.ipynb`)  
- **Decision Tree** (`Decision_Tree.ipynb`)  
- **K-Means Clustering** (`Kmean.ipynb`)  
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** (`LSTM.ipynb`)  
- **Random Forest** (`Random_forest.ipynb`)  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (`svm.ipynb`)  

## Datasets  
The datasets used for this project are also uploaded to this repository. However, due to size limitations, the full datasets are hosted on Google Drive. You can access them using the link below:

## Instructions to Use Google Drive and Google Colab  

### Step 1: Upload Datasets to Google Drive  
1. Go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).  
2. Create a new folder named **"Datasets"**.  
3. Upload all the datasets into this folder.  

### Step 2: Open Google Colab and Mount Google Drive  
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Mount your Google Drive in Colab by running the following code:  

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
